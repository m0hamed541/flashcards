- **Session Linking**: Associates progress with specific learning sessions

#### Enhanced Card Schema
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard classification
- **Review Tracking**: Counts total reviews and correct answers
- **Last Reviewed**: Timestamp of most recent review
- **Next Review**: Planned review date (future enhancement)

#### Enhanced Deck Schema
- **Learning Progress**: Tracks total learned cards
- **Study History**: Records last study session
- **Performance Metrics**: Average accuracy across sessions

### New Hooks

#### `useLearningSessionManager()`
- **startLearningSession(deckId)**: Creates new learning session
- **completeLearningSession(sessionId, correctAnswers, duration)**: Finalizes session
- **recordCardResult(cardId, deckId, sessionId, result, responseTime)**: Records individual card results

#### `useDeckStats(deckId)`
- **Progress Calculation**: Real-time progress percentage
- **Session Analytics**: Total sessions and average accuracy
- **Learning History**: Last studied date and completion stats

#### `useCardsByDeck(deckId)`
- **Filtered Cards**: Returns only cards belonging to specific deck
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically updates when cards change

## Navigation Flow

1. **Decks Tab** → **Deck Card** → **Deck View Screen**
2. **Deck View Screen** → **Start Learning Button** → **Learning Screen**
3. **Learning Screen** → **Card Review** → **Results Summary** → **TinyStore Update**

## Animation Features

### Deck View Animations
- **Fade-in**: Header and cards appear with smooth opacity transitions
- **Slide-up**: Content slides up from bottom with staggered timing
- **Scale**: Cards scale slightly on press for tactile feedback

### Learning Screen Animations
- **Card Entry**: Cards scale and fade in when appearing
- **Swipe Gestures**: Real-time position, rotation, and scale updates
- **Card Exit**: Smooth exit animations with rotation and scaling
- **Progress Updates**: Animated progress bar with scale effects

## Usage Instructions

### Starting a Learning Session
1. Navigate to the Decks tab
2. Tap on a deck card to open the Deck View
3. Tap "Start Learning" button
4. Begin reviewing cards one by one

### Learning Interface
1. **View Question**: Card displays the question initially
2. **Reveal Answer**: Tap the card to show the answer
3. **Mark Result**: Use swipe gestures or buttons:
   - Swipe right or tap "Correct" for correct answers
   - Swipe left or tap "Incorrect" for wrong answers
4. **Continue**: Cards automatically advance to the next
5. **Complete Session**: View results and choose to restart or return

### Swipe Gestures
- **Swipe Right**: Mark card as correct
- **Swipe Left**: Mark card as incorrect
- **Tap**: Toggle answer visibility
- **Threshold**: Swipe must exceed 25% of screen width or be fast

## Technical Implementation

### Animation System
- Uses React Native's `Animated` API
- Native driver for optimal performance
- Spring and timing animations for smooth interactions
- Gesture handling with `PanGestureHandler`

### State Management
- **TinyStore Integration**: Real-time data persistence
- **Learning Sessions**: Complete session lifecycle management
- **Progress Tracking**: Individual card and deck statistics
- **Performance Analytics**: Response times and accuracy metrics

### Performance Optimizations
- Native driver for animations
- Efficient gesture handling
- Optimized re-renders
- Smooth 60fps animations
- TinyStore's efficient data management

## Data Flow

### Learning Session Lifecycle
1. **Session Start**: `startLearningSession()` creates new session record
2. **Card Review**: `recordCardResult()` tracks each card interaction
3. **Session End**: `completeLearningSession()` finalizes and calculates metrics
4. **Progress Update**: Deck and card statistics are automatically updated

### Real-time Updates
- **Deck Progress**: Automatically recalculates based on card reviews
- **Card Statistics**: Updates review counts and accuracy in real-time
- **Session Analytics**: Tracks performance across multiple learning sessions

## Future Enhancements

- **Spaced Repetition**: Implement intelligent card scheduling using `nextReview` field
- **Study Modes**: Different learning strategies (review, test, etc.)
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed learning progress and statistics
- **Offline Support**: Cache cards for offline learning
- **Customization**: Adjustable animation speeds and gestures
- **Performance Insights**: Learning patterns and improvement suggestions

## Dependencies

- `tinybase`: Core data management and persistence
- `react-native-gesture-handler`: For swipe gestures
- `@expo/vector-icons`: For icon display
- `expo-router`: For navigation
- `nativewind`: For styling

## Testing

To test the new screens:
1. Run the app and navigate to Decks tab
2. Tap on any deck to open Deck View
3. Tap "Start Learning" to begin a learning session
4. Test swipe gestures and button interactions
5. Complete a session to see results
6. Check that data is persisted in TinyStore

## Data Persistence

All learning data is automatically persisted in TinyStore:
- **Learning Sessions**: Complete session records with metrics
- **Card Progress**: Individual card performance tracking
- **Deck Statistics**: Real-time progress and accuracy calculations
- **User Performance**: Historical data for analytics and improvement

The implementation provides a **smooth, engaging learning experience** with intuitive gestures, beautiful animations, and **complete data persistence** that will significantly improve user engagement, retention, and learning outcomes.
